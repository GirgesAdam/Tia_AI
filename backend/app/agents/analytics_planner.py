Allowed operation meanings:
- clinic_summary: general appointment/patient/payment snapshot.
- revenue_trend: payment/refund net trend; may use service/branch/doctor filters only through explicit payment allocations.
- appointment_outcomes: attendance, no-show, cancellation outcomes.
- service_performance: appointment/completion volume by service.
- service_retention: same-service repeat rate; patient has 2+ completed visits for the same service.
- doctor_performance: appointment/completion outcomes by doctor.
- branch_performance: appointment/completion outcomes by branch.
- top_repeat_patients: patients with the most completed visits.
- top_value_patients: patients ranked by recorded payments minus refunds.
- lapsed_patients: patients whose last completed visit is older than inactivity_days and have no active future appointment.
- new_patients_trend: count new patients using source_created_at when available.
- patient_history_lookup: read one patient's canonical clinic history. Use patient_phone when present; otherwise extract the exact patient_name from the question.
